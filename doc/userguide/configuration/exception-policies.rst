Exception Policies
==================

Suricata has a set of configuration variables to indicate what should the engine
do when certain exception conditions, such as hitting a memcap, are reached.

They are called Exception Policies and are configurable via suricata.yaml. If
enabled, the engine will call them when it  reaches exception states.

For developers or for researching purposes, there are also simulation options
exposed in debug mode and passed via command-line. These exist to force or
simulate failures or errors and understand Suri behavior under such conditions.

Exception Policies
------------------

Exception policies are implemented for:

.. list-table:: Exception Policies configuration variables
   :widths: 20, 18, 62
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Config setting
     - Policy variable
     - Expected behavior
   * - stream.memcap
     - memcap-policy
     - If a stream session's memcap limits are reached, call the memcap policy
       on the packet and flow.
   * - stream.midstream
     - midstream-policy
     - If a session is picked up midstream, call the memcap policy on the packet
       and flow.
   * - stream.reassembly.memcap
     - memcap-policy
     - If stream reassembly reaches memcap limit, call the memcap policy on the
       packet and flow.
   * - flow.memcap
     - memcap-policy
     - Apply policy when the memcap limit for flow is reached and no flow could
       be freed up.
   * - defrag.memcap
     - memcap-policy
     - Apply policy when the memcap limit for defrag is reached and no tracker
       could be picked up.
   * - app-layer
     - error-policy
     - Apply policy if a parser reaches an error state.

To change any of those, check the corresponding section in the suricata.yaml
file. The possible values, and their resulting behaviors, are:

- ``drop-flow``: disable inspection for the whole flow (packets, payload,
  application layer protocol), drop the packet and all future packets in the
  flow.
- ``drop-packet``: drop the packet.
- ``reject``: same as ``drop-flow``, but reject the first packet as well.
- ``bypass``: bypass the flow. No further inspection is done. :ref:`Bypass
  <bypass>` may be offloaded.
- ``pass-flow``: disable payload and packet inspection, stream reassembly,
  app-layer parsing and logging still happen.
- ``pass-packet``: disables detection, still does stream updates and app-layer
  parsing (depeding on which policy triggered it).
- ``ignore``: do not apply exception policies (keeps default behavior).

*Drop*, *pass* and *reject* have similar effects to the ones for :ref:`rule
actions<suricata-yaml-action-order>`.

Command-line Options for Simulating Exceptions
----------------------------------------------

It is also possible to force specific exception scenarios, to check engine
behavior under failure or error conditions.

The available command-line options are:

- ``simulate-applayer-error-at-offset-ts``: force an applayer error in the to
  server direction at the given offset.
- ``simulate-applayer-error-at-offset-tc``: force an applayer error in the to
  client direction at the given offset.
- ``simulate-packet-loss``: simulate that the packet with the given number
  (``pcap_cnt``) from the session was lost.
- ``simulate-packet-tcp-reassembly-memcap``: simulate that the TCP stream
  reassembly reached memcap for the specified packet.
- ``simulate-packet-tcp-ssn-memcap``: simulate that the TCP session hit the
  memcap for the specified packet.
- ``simulate-packet-flow-memcap``: force the engine to assume that flow memcap is
  hit at the given packet.
- ``simulate-packet-defrag-memcap``: force Suricata to assume memcap is hit when
  defragmenting specified packet.
- ``simulate-alert-queue-realloc-failure``: prevent the engine from dynamically
  growing the temporary alert queue, during alerts processing.

Common abbreviations
--------------------

- applayer: application layer protocol
- memcap: (maximum) memory capacity available
- defrag: defragmentation
