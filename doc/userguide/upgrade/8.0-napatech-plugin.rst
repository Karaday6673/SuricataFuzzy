NAPATECH as a Plugin
====================

Suricata 8.0 moves NAPATECH support to a dynamically loaded plugin. For
convenience, this plugin is still bundled with Suricata, but it may be
removed from the Suricata source tree into its own repository in a
future release.

Upgrading
---------

Suricata 8.0 continues to respect the ``--enable-napatech`` compile time
option, as well as the ``--napatech`` command line options, and also
the ``napatech`` section of the configuration file.

.. note:: When the NAPATECH plugin is eventually removed from the
          Suricata source tree these options may be removed and/or
          changed as this would allow the NAPATECH plugin to have its
          own release cycle and make changes independent of Suricata.

However, the ``napatech`` plugin must be loaded before it can be
used. If doing a fresh build of Suricata with NAPATECH support, the
``suricata.yaml`` configuration file should be configured to load the
plugin already, for example::

  plugins:
    - /usr/lib/suricata/napatech.so

If you are upgrading, you will need to add the location of
``napatech.so`` to the ``plugins`` section of your ``suricata.yaml``
manually.

Then your existing NAPATECH command line options and configuration
should continue to work.

Caveats
-------

Currently building the NAPATECH plugin is not compatible with the
``--disable-shared`` configure argument.
